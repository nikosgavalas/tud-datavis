# IN4089 Data Visualisation

## Assignment 1 (InfoVis)

Roadmap:

1. do something about the null values in the scatter
2. update the scatter using the same time bar (merge the map and scatter js files into one first?)
3. scatter sizes according to total population
4. scatter colors same as map? (-working population?)
5. make the charts responsive
6. add the two other charts ?

Data schema (data.js):

```
{
  AFG: {
    "population-young": [...],
    "population-working-age": [...],
    "population-old": [...],
    "population-growth": [...],
    "life-expectancy": [...],
    gdp: [...],
    "gdp-growth": [...],
    fertility: [...],
  },
}
```
