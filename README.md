# IN4089 Data Visualisation

## Assignment 1 (InfoVis)

Roadmap:

1. do something about the null values in the scatter
2. scatter sizes according to total population
3. scatter colors same as map? (-working population?)
4. make the charts responsive
5. add the two other charts ?

Data schema:

```
{
  AFG: {
    "population-young": [...],
    "population-working-age": [...],
    "population-old": [...],
    "population-growth": [...],
    "life-expectancy": [...],
    gdp: [...],
    "gdp-growth": [...],
    fertility: [...],
  },
}
```
