# IN4089 Data Visualisation

## Assignment 1 (InfoVis)

Roadmap:

- [x] do something about the null values in the scatter
- [x] update the scatter using the same time bar (merge the map and scatter js files into one first?)
- [x] scatter sizes according to total population
- [x] scatter colors same as map? (-working population?)
- [x] focus dot on mouseover on map
- [ ] make the charts responsive
- [ ] add the two other charts ?

Data schema (data.js):

```
{
  AFG: {
    "population-young": [...],
    "population-working-age": [...],
    "population-old": [...],
    "population-total": [...],
    "population-growth": [...],
    "life-expectancy": [...],
    gdp: [...],
    "gdp-growth": [...],
    fertility: [...],
  },
}
```
