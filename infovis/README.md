# IN4089 Data Visualisation

## Assignment 1 (InfoVis)

Roadmap:

- [x] do something about the null values in the scatter
- [x] update the scatter using the same time bar (merge the map and scatter js files into one first?)
- [x] scatter sizes according to total population
- [x] scatter colors same as map? (-working population?)
- [x] focus dot on mouseover on map
- [x] display axis names
- [x] axis names and chart titles
- [x] make the charts responsive
- [ ] add the two other charts (optional)

Data schema (data.js):

```
{
  AFG: {
    "population-working-age": [...],
    "population-total": [...],
    "population-growth": [...],
    "gdp-per-capita": [...],
  },
}
```
